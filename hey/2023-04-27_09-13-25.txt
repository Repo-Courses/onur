Market segmentation is dividing a market into smaller groups of customers who share similar characteristics. Here are the criteria for effective segmentation, explained more simply:
 1 Measurable: The group should have data that can be collected and analyzed, like age or income.
 2 Substantial: The group should be big enough to be worth targeting with marketing efforts.
 3 Accessible: The group should be easy to reach using marketing channels, like ads or social media.
 4 Differentiable: The groups should be unique from one another so that each can be targeted with specific strategies.
 5 Actionable: The segmentation should help businesses create plans to target each group effectively.
